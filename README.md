## üìÅ Project Structure Overview

The Symbolic codebase follows a carefully architected modular design that separates concerns and enables independent development of core systems:

- **`kernel/`** - Contains the foundational language runtime, including the core AST node definitions, basic type system, and execution engine interfaces. This is the heart of the language implementation.

- **`parsing/`** - Houses the complete lexical analysis and parsing infrastructure, including the tokenizer, recursive descent parser, error recovery mechanisms, and AST construction utilities.

- **`runtime/`** - Implements the multi-tiered execution system, containing the AST interpreter, bytecode compiler and VM, JIT compilation interface, and memory management subsystems.

- **`domains/`** - Contains the pluggable domain extension system, with specialized modules for mathematics (`math/`), physics (`physics/`), finance (`finance/`), and the domain plugin loading infrastructure.

- **`stdlib/`** - Provides the comprehensive standard library implementation, including collections, I/O operations, networking, mathematical functions, and utility modules.

- **`tests/`** - Comprehensive test suite covering unit tests, integration tests, performance benchmarks, and domain-specific test cases.

- **`tools/`** - Development and debugging utilities, including the interactive REPL, performance profiler, syntax highlighter, and language server implementation.

This structure reflects a deep understanding of compiler architecture, enabling clear separation between language specification, implementation, and extension mechanisms.

## üöÄ Performance Philosophy

Symbolic is designed with a **"start fast, optimize selectively"** philosophy that prioritizes both development velocity and runtime performance:

- **Immediate Execution**: Code runs immediately through the AST interpreter, enabling rapid prototyping and debugging
- **Adaptive Optimization**: The system automatically profiles execution patterns and promotes hot paths to more efficient execution tiers
- **JIT Integration**: The `@jit` directive provides explicit control over compilation to native code for performance-critical sections
- **Memory Efficiency**: Sophisticated garbage collection with generational collection and cycle detection minimizes memory overhead
- **Symbolic Optimizations**: Mathematical expressions undergo algebraic simplification and symbolic optimization before execution

This approach ensures that Symbolic code runs efficiently whether it's being used for interactive exploration or production mathematical computing workloads.
